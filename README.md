# node-server-exercise
practicing using raw Node

Hey there 👋
In this repo you'll find 🤖 robot uprisings, 🍄 magical mushrooms, and a simple Node server! Maybe there's another surprise or two tucked away in here, too.

- First, ☑️ I worked on displaying simple HTML, routing, and triggering a download.
- Next, I'm not sure yet. 
    - Maybe some transform streams? 
    - Probably should work on robustifying what I do have with some error handling, eh?

Yeah, 💪 robustifying is a good idea.
So are 🦛 hippos.
I made a metronome once where you could pick the sound, and had things like 🐱 meows and 🐓 crowing and 🐶 barking as options. Maybe I'll remake that, because I'm pretty sure the world needs more metronomes that make a panoply of animal sounds.

In my front-end work, there's a lot of back-end, so it's really full-stack. I'd like to play more with the tech that while I do work with it, I don't work _that_ in depth with it, so some practice and playing sounded like a good idea.
And voil&agrave;, here we are in this here repo.

This isn't the best README, but🤷, you get what you get.

Um, `npm install` to get all the goodies, if you want to use a locally scoped nodemon. Then you can...
- enter `npm watch` to start nodemon and the node server
- you'll see the server serving up some html at localhost:8080

Otherwise, if you've got Node installed, you can 
- navigate to the root directory of this project
- enter `npm run start`
- and the server should start (you'll see `Server running on port 8080` in the terminal if all is successful)
- Then you can type `http://localhost:8080/` in a browser and you should see the index page all served up!
